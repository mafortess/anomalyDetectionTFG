        <h2>Available Simulations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simulation 1: High Availability Servers</strong><br>
                Three Ubuntu servers are monitored in separate virtual machines to simulate a high availability environment. Each server has Node Exporter installed to scrape system metrics such as CPU, RAM, storage, and network traffic. Additionally, Tshark is installed on each server to capture network traffic and send it to CloudShark for analysis. Stress-ng is used to ensure consistent CPU and RAM load across the servers, with alerts set up for deviations exceeding 20%. Notifications are sent via email, Discord, and Telegram when anomalies are detected.</li>
            <li><strong>Simulation 2: Docker Engine Monitoring</strong><br>
                Three Docker engines are monitored, each running three instances of docker-compose including a server, an application, and a database. Tshark captures network traffic and sends it to CloudShark. Stress-ng is used to simulate load, with alerts configured for load deviations. Metrics for each Docker engine are displayed in Grafana panels, with notifications sent via email, Discord, and Telegram for any issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Simulation 3: Energy Consumption Monitoring</strong><br>
                This simulation monitors energy consumption using a combination of theoretical simulation and real-time monitoring. Random energy consumption values are generated by a C script in ESP32 and scraped by Prometheus. </li>
            <li><strong>Simulation 4: Host and Container Anomaly Detection</strong><br>
                Hosts and containers are monitored using Isolation Forest models to detect anomalies in real-time. Data on CPU, RAM, and network traffic is collected and processed to train the models. Grafana displays metrics and anomalies, with alerts and notifications sent for detected issues.</li>
